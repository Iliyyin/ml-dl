This repository contains the outcomes of hands-on machine learning and deep learning projects. It's a collection of practical experiments, performance optimizations, and lessons learned from labouring and testing different models and data pipelines. From building custom DataLoaders to profiling GPU utilization, this is where theory meets practice.
